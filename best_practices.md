# Best Practices for HN Notifier API

## Introduction

This guide outlines best practices for using the HN Notifier API efficiently. By following these recommendations, you can optimize your usage of the service and ensure a smooth experience for both you and other users.

## Polling Frequency

When checking for new comments on followed items, it's important to strike a balance between staying up-to-date and avoiding unnecessary API calls. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Implement a reasonable polling interval**: We suggest polling the `/check` endpoint no more frequently than once every 5-10 minutes. This provides a good balance between timely updates and server load.

2. **Use exponential backoff**: If you don't receive any notifications, consider increasing the interval between checks. This helps reduce unnecessary API calls during periods of inactivity.

3. **Respect rate limits**: While we currently don't enforce strict rate limits, be mindful of your API usage and avoid making excessive requests.

Example of implementing a simple exponential backoff:

```javascript
let interval = 5 * 60 * 1000; // Start with 5 minutes
const maxInterval = 30 * 60 * 1000; // Max interval of 30 minutes

async function checkForUpdates() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-api-endpoint.com/check');
    const notifications = await response.json();
    
    if (notifications.length > 0) {
      // Reset interval if we received notifications
      interval = 5 * 60 * 1000;
      // Process notifications
    } else {
      // Increase interval, but cap it at maxInterval
      interval = Math.min(interval * 2, maxInterval);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking for updates:', error);
  }
  
  // Schedule next check
  setTimeout(checkForUpdates, interval);
}

// Start checking
checkForUpdates();
```

## Managing Followed Items

Efficient management of followed items can improve your experience with the API:

1. **Limit the number of followed items**: While there's no hard limit, we recommend following no more than 50-100 items at a time. This helps maintain good performance for both you and the service.

2. **Regularly unfollow inactive items**: Use the `/unfollow/:id` endpoint to stop following items that are no longer active or relevant. This keeps your followed items list manageable and reduces unnecessary checks.

3. **Batch operations when possible**: When following or unfollowing multiple items, consider implementing a queue system to spread out your API calls over time, rather than making many requests at once.

Example of a simple batching system:

```javascript
class FollowQueue {
  constructor(batchSize = 5, intervalMs = 1000) {
    this.queue = [];
    this.batchSize = batchSize;
    this.intervalMs = intervalMs;
  }

  add(id) {
    this.queue.push(id);
    if (this.queue.length >= this.batchSize) {
      this.processQueue();
    }
  }

  async processQueue() {
    const batch = this.queue.splice(0, this.batchSize);
    for (const id of batch) {
      try {
        await fetch(`https://your-api-endpoint.com/follow/${id}`);
        console.log(`Followed item ${id}`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error following item ${id}:`, error);
      }
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, this.intervalMs));
    }
  }
}

const followQueue = new FollowQueue();

// Usage:
followQueue.add(123456);
followQueue.add(789012);
// ... add more items as needed
```

## Error Handling and Retries

Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms:

1. **Handle API errors gracefully**: Check for and handle various HTTP status codes appropriately. For example, implement different behaviors for 4xx (client errors) and 5xx (server errors) responses.

2. **Implement retries with backoff**: For transient errors (e.g., network issues or temporary server problems), implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.

Example of a simple retry mechanism:

```javascript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      if (response.ok) return response.json();
      if (response.status >= 400 && response.status < 500) {
        // Don't retry client errors
        throw new Error(`Client error: ${response.status}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
}

// Usage:
try {
  const data = await fetchWithRetry('https://your-api-endpoint.com/check');
  // Process data
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to fetch after multiple retries:', error);
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, you can ensure efficient use of the HN Notifier API, maintain good performance, and create a better experience for both you and other users of the service. Remember to always be considerate of API usage and implement smart polling and management strategies in your applications.
